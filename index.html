            <b>-OUR STORY-<br>
        
            The history of Brake and Take Restaurant is built on a love story: A love for food, tradition, family and friends.
        
            It was love that sparked a Serbian soccer player, Danilo Nikolić, to introduce himself to a cheerleader, Maha.
            Captivated by this charming fellow, Maha found it impossible to dismiss her feelings as a simple crush, and Danilo
            was
            absolutely taken with the beautiful young lady who watched all of his games. Their romance led them to ultimately
            wed
            and become partners not only in love but in business, as well.<br>
            With only a few dollars in his pocket and a dream in his heart, Danilo moved to the United States with the pursuit
            of
            the American Dream in his mind. He took up construction in Virginia where he met the love of his life, Maha.
            Shortly
            after, Danilo and Maha started a new chapter of their lives in Las Vegas. A love for traditional Serbian food,
            inspired in Danilo the idea of starting a restaurant. Danilo, a passionate cook, taught Maha how
            to make his family’s recipes and instilled in her the fondness of cooking. In 1980 they opened their first
            restaurant—a
            small Serbian fast-food concept with only four tables—on the corner of 10th and Charleston Boulevard. Critical
            demand
            caused them to expand three years later, but success beyond their expectations allowed them to dream even
            bigger.<br>
        
            In 1990, Danilo and Maha expanded their family business from its original location. With his construction expertise,
            Danilo remodeled the new "Brake and Take" Restaurant, located on the corner of E Charleston and S Casino Center
            Boulevard,
            making the restaurant one of the best Serbian establishments in Las Vegas for over 10 years.
            Almost 40 years later, the Nikolić legacy stands as a staple of the Las Vegas dining community. Brake and Take has
            been
            recognized multiple times as the Best Serbian Restaurant in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Review Journal, among other
            publications. But perhaps what is most important, what can be experienced with each visit to
            Brake and Take Restaurant, is a dedication and desire to make everyone feel like a family. That passion, that love,
            has always
            been the heart of Danilo and Maha Nikolić.</b>
